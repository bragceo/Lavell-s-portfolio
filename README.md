## How does the code work?

The webpage is structured with a header, a hero section, an "About Me" section, a "Work" section displaying a portfolio of projects, and a "Contact Me" section.

The header contains my name and a navigation bar with links to the different sections of the page. The hero section contains an image and a heading. The "About Me" section includes a brief biography. In the "Work" section, there are three portfolio items, each represented by a link to the project, and displayed using a grid layout. Each project I did is represented as an image link that opens in a new browser tab. The "Contact Me" section includes contact information, such as phone number and email, and links to the person's GitHub and Twitter profiles.

The CSS code is responsible for the overall aesthetics and layout of the webpage. The code uses CSS variables for color themes, Flexbox for layout management, media queries for responsiveness, smooth scrolling, and custom typography. The CSS also features a Grid layout for arranging portfolio items in the "Work" section, and different hover effects for the navigation and contact links. The media queries at the end ensure that the layout adjusts accordingly for different viewport sizes, making the webpage responsive for mobile view.
